# Privacy Policy for AutoSift

**Last Updated:** January 22, 2026

AutoSift ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed by the AutoSift Chrome Extension.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Personal Information (Via Authentication)
We use **Supabase** (a secure, third-party backend) to manage user accounts. When you sign in using Google, we collect basic profile information provided by Google:
-   Email address
-   Name/Display Name
-   Profile Picture

This information is used strictly for:
-   Verifying your identity.
-   Managing your subscription/trial status.
-   Syncing your basic usage metrics (e.g., "hours used today") across your devices.

### B. Usage Data
We collect minimal, non-sensitive usage statistics to enforce plan limits (e.g., Free Trial limits) and improve the service:
-   Number of leads processed.
-   Duration of automation sessions.
-   Application errors (for debugging purposes).

### C. Lead Data (Processed Locally)
**We do NOT collect or store the business leads you process.**
-   All lead filtering, extraction within the extension happens **locally on your device**.
-   Lead data (Buyer Name, Phone, Email, etc.) is temporarily processed in your browser's memory to perform the automation actions (Hide/Shortlist/Contact).
-   This data is **never sent to our servers**.

## 2. How We Use and Share Information
-   **No Sale of Data:** We do not sell your personal data to third parties.
-   **Service Providers:** We share necessary authentication data with Supabase (our backend provider) strictly to operate the login and database service.
-   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.

## 3. Data Security
We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information. Authentication tokens are stored securely in your browser's local storage. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%.

## 4. Your Rights
You may request the deletion of your account and associated data at any time by contacting us at the support email provided in the extension.
